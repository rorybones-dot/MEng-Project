# MEng-Project
## Is bamboo a viable sustainable alternative to structural steel in the design of complex pavilions in the UK?
The purpose of this GitHub is to for the distribution of files associated with my MEng project of the above title. 
The GitHub is structured into two primary folders: Dynamo, and Robot. Both folders contain files from their associated software, Dynamo and Robot structural analysis respectively. Both the dynamo and robot folders contain only the models for the final iteration of their respective materials. All other iterations take a similar form and their viewing would not supply much additional insight to the modelling process.
